# To-Do List README

This repository contains the code for the **To-Do List** web application, which allows users to create, edit, and manage their tasks using local storage for data persistence.

## Overview

The To-Do List project is a web application that simplifies task management. Users can create, edit, and delete tasks, and their data is stored locally so that tasks persist between sessions. It's a handy tool for personal organization.

## Installation

To run the To-Do List locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CodSoft.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `ToDoList` directory:

   ```
   cd CodSoft/ToDoList
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start using the To-Do List.

## Usage

Using the To-Do List is easy. Add tasks, mark them as completed, edit task details, or remove tasks as needed. Your tasks will be saved locally and remain accessible even after you close the browser.
